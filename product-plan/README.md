# KasamaHR — Design Handoff

This folder contains everything needed to implement KasamaHR, a multi-tenant HR management system for the Philippine market.

## What's Included

**Ready-to-Use Prompts:**
- `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md` — Prompt for full implementation in one session
- `prompts/section-prompt.md` — Prompt template for section-by-section implementation

**Instructions:**
- `product-overview.md` — Product summary (always provide with any implementation)
- `instructions/one-shot-instructions.md` — All milestones combined for full implementation
- `instructions/incremental/` — 6 milestone instructions (foundation + 5 sections)

**Design Assets:**
- `design-system/` — Colors, fonts, CSS tokens
- `data-model/` — Entity types and relationships
- `shell/` — Application shell components (sidebar, header, user menu)
- `sections/` — 5 section component packages with test instructions

## Sections

| # | Section | Components |
|---|---------|------------|
| 1 | Foundation | Shell, Design Tokens, Data Model |
| 2 | Employee Management | Dashboard, List, Profile |
| 3 | Time & Attendance | Dashboard, DTR List, Schedule List |
| 4 | Payroll & Compliance | Dashboard, Period List, Record List, Reports Hub |
| 5 | Leave Management | Dashboard, Type List, Approval Queue, Calendar |
| 6 | Self-Service Portal | Dashboard, Payslip Viewer, DTR View, Leave, Approvals |

## How to Use This

### Option A: Incremental (Recommended)

Build your app milestone by milestone for better control:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your implementation codebase
2. Start with Foundation (`instructions/incremental/01-foundation.md`)
3. For each section:
   - Open `prompts/section-prompt.md`
   - Fill in the section variables at the top (SECTION_NAME, SECTION_ID, NN)
   - Copy/paste into your coding agent
   - Answer questions and implement
4. Review and test after each milestone

### Option B: One-Shot

Build the entire app in one session:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your implementation codebase
2. Open `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md`
3. Copy/paste the prompt into your coding agent
4. Answer the agent's clarifying questions
5. Let the agent plan and implement everything

## Test-Driven Development

Each section includes a `tests.md` file with test-writing instructions. For best results:

1. Read `sections/[section-id]/tests.md` before implementing
2. Write failing tests based on the instructions
3. Implement the feature to make tests pass
4. Refactor while keeping tests green

The test instructions are **framework-agnostic** — they describe WHAT to test, not HOW. Adapt to your testing setup (Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress, RSpec, Minitest, PHPUnit, etc.).

## Tips

- **Use the pre-written prompts** — They include important clarifying questions about auth and data modeling
- **Always provide product-overview.md** — It gives essential context for any implementation session
- **Add your own notes** — Customize prompts with project-specific context when needed
- **Build incrementally** — Use section-by-section approach for better control and review
- **Review thoroughly** — Check plans and implementations carefully to catch details
- **Fill in the gaps** — Backend business logic may need manual additions
